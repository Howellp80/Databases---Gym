This project is a database driven website (Node, Express, handlebars, SQL, javascript, etc.) modeling a gym. The gym has members, which in turn have memberships. The members also have exercice routines which are composed of different exercises. This information is stored, retrieved from, and updated on a MySQL database.

To run, setup a MySQL database and run the file "TableCreation.sql" on it. Then setup your Node environment, including the "dbcon.js"  file to properly connect to your database. At this point you should be able to succesfully interact with your database using the website UI.
